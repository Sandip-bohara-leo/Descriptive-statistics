# Descriptive-statistics
This repository contains an R script for performing descriptive statistical analysis on a dataset named WHEAT, which includes agro-morphological traits of wheat genotypes. The analysis covers both basic statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum) and extended statistics (standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis) using the pastecs package.
